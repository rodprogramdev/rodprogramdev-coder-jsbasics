Statements in JavaScript will be executed sequentially.

A Statement is composed of one or more expressions. 

An expression is made up of operators and operands.

Arithmetic Operators + - * / 

+  Plus sign > "String concatenation operator" , "Adding values"

= Equal sign , "Assignment operator"

/*OPERANDS*/

// We as the programmer can give operands their name.


/*EXPRESSIONS - these are a combination of values, variables and opertors*/


// Variable declaration

let e = b + c; // We have three expressions in this single line statement.

// First: let e; ... variable declaration
// Second: perform an evaluation ... b + c > Is adding to values 
// Third: Assigning a value assign the result of b + c to variable e
